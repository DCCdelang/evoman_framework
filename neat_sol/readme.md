## Explaination of Solution folders

Sol 3, 5, 6 and 7 do not contain any hidden neurons at initialization.

Sol 8 - 12 do containt the 20 IN - 10 HID - 5 OUT topology just as in the
evoman framework.

Sol 1 - 12 are trained on enemy 1 and 2, or 7 and 8. 

From sol 13 the experiments started for the research using NEAT properly with
an 20 IN - 5 OUT network at the beginning. Starting with 40 pop and 30 GEN.
